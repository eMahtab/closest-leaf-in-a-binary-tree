# Closest Leaf in a binary tree
Closest Leaf node from a given node in a binary tree

## https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-leaf-in-a-binary-tree


## Approach : Create graph from the given tree and BFS
We will first create a graph from the given binary tree. Once we have the graph, all we need to do is to find the first leaf node, starting from the sourceNode `k`
This problem is, finding the shortest path in an unweighted undirected graph.
